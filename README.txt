Welcome to the beagleframework.

This is still in beta but has a fully functioning CRUD system and an advanced result list system.

You will need to install jQuery to use the advanced features.

This is under the MIT licenses so please use this as you see fit.  If you make imporovements to the
base framework, please email me at admin@beaglecrm.com with your changes so I am add them to the code
base.

make a copy of the htaccess.sample file and call it .htaccess

Follow the instructions in the .hataccess file to get your system working.  
If you have XDEBUG, from (http://xdebug.org/) you can turn on the debugging options from the .htaccess file
